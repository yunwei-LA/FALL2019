## The Assignment 4 Teams Copied Below (please modify for the Final Project)

Just like Assignment 4, you may form your own team for the work on this project. A team may have 4, 5, or 6 members only.  No other combinations are acceptable. 

If your team from Assignment 4 has changed, please make the appropriate changes below.  I am assuming most teams are staying
the same (but I could be wrong) 

Please identify your team (give it a name) and identify the members of the team in the space below. <h4>Please also identify your sections if your team is comprised of members from different sections</h4>
